# BETA_QA_PLAN.md — GoHustlr Beta QA Plan

_Verified 2026-07-07 at commit a70c9b5 (master)._

An executable, manual-first QA plan for the GoHustlr beta. GoHustlr is a TaskRabbit-style two-sided gig marketplace aimed at college students, running as three apps on one Supabase backend: **MOBILE** (Expo/React Native, `src/` + `App.js`), **WEB** (Next.js 16, `web/`), **ADMIN CONSOLE** (Next.js 16, `admin/`). Shared pure-ESM logic lives in `shared/` (`@gohustlr/shared`). Backend = Supabase (Postgres + RLS, Auth, Realtime, Storage) + **23** Deno edge functions (each `supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts`; no `_shared` dir — AUDIT_REPORT.md/CLAUDE.md say 24, off by one vs. disk). Payments = Stripe in **TEST mode for beta** (`admin/lib/config.ts:19` default `/test`) **[Needs Fable Review — live cutover mode unverifiable from code]**, manual-capture escrow, Connect Express payouts, Identity, tips.

This document stands alone: enforcement points, expected results, and severity are inlined. Companion docs (do not need to be read to execute this plan): `ROLE_PERMISSION_MATRIX.md`, `PRODUCT_FLOW_MAP.md`, `LIFECYCLE_STATE_MACHINES.md`, `KNOWN_RISKS.md`, `BASELINE_STATUS.md`, `CURRENT_COMMANDS.md`.

## 1. Current automated coverage & testing philosophy for beta

### 1.1 What automation exists today

- **79 passing unit tests, pure logic only.** 10 Jest suites in `__tests__/` (`analytics, availability, certified, contentFilter, filters, finance, geo, moderationSync, school, taxFormat`). Runner: Jest 29.7.0, `testEnvironment: 'node'`, `testMatch: ['**/__tests__/**/*.test.js']` (`jest.config.js:1-9`). No coverage flags, no CI-visible thresholds, no coverage gate.
- Every test imports a leaf module and asserts on return values. **No test touches money movement, no state transition, no permission boundary, no auth flow, no rendering, no network, no Supabase, no Stripe, no RLS, no navigation.**
- **`web/` is explicitly excluded from Jest** (`testPathIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/', '/ios/', '/android/', '/web/']`, `jest.config.js:7`). `admin/` is not excluded but has **zero** test files. Confirmed by `find` across the repo: there are **no** `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` files under `web/`, `admin/`, `shared/`, `src/`, or `supabase/`.
- **No e2e / integration harness anywhere** — no Detox, Maestro, Playwright, or Cypress. No seeded-Supabase / Stripe-test-mode integration project in-repo. The core money loop (post → book → accept → complete → verify → rate) has **zero** automated end-to-end coverage.

**Genuinely well-covered (pure logic, cross-platform via `shared/`):** content-moderation string normalization incl. leetspeak/homoglyph/punctuation evasion (`contentFilter.test.js` against `shared/contentFilter.js`); the moderation blocklist drift guard (`moderationSync.test.js` asserts the RN client, the Deno `assistant` edge fn, and the Postgres `contains_prohibited` blocklists are identical); CSV/tax-export formula-injection neutralization (`taxFormat.test.js:23-39`); finance-coach math; discovery/matching (`matchesForYou`, `skillFitScore`); insights and the 50-job certification threshold; availability, geo distance, and `.edu` parsing.

### 1.2 Testing philosophy for beta

1. **Manual matrix now.** This document is the source of truth for beta. Every test below is executable by a human tester across mobile, web, and admin with a small set of seeded accounts. Run the full matrix before external users, and re-run the Smoke + Auth + money-loop subset before every deploy.
2. **Automate the money loop before external users.** The highest-value automation gap is the escrow money loop. Before external users, stand up a minimal happy-path e2e (Maestro or Detox for mobile; a seeded Supabase + Stripe test-mode integration for the edge/DB layer) that proves: post → book → accept (escrow authorized) → mark-done ×2 → verify (escrow captured, earnings credited exactly once) → tip credited once. This is called out as a remaining P0 item in `LAUNCH_PLAN` and `ROADMAP`.
3. **Extract-and-unit-test the arithmetic that moves real dollars.** Payment-intent amount/fee/bounds (`stripe-create-payment-intent/index.ts:94-101`), capture split (`stripe-capture-payment/index.ts:99-130`), tip bounds (`stripe-tip/index.ts:27`), and the cancellation-fee formula (`src/context/JobsContext.js:118-128`) are all untested pure math. Extract each into `shared/` and unit-test before beta — cheap, high value.
4. **Two-client RLS integration tests are the single biggest untested security surface.** The 48 tracked migrations under `supabase/migrations/` encode every permission boundary; no automated test proves any policy actually denies a cross-user read/write. Where automation is not yet in place, the Permission / Data-privacy sections below cover these boundaries manually.

**Deploy caveat that shapes QA:** many `AUDIT_REPORT.md` fixes are code-complete on `master` but marked "needs push/deploy." The **live** system may not yet have: certificates MIME allowlist, private `chat-photos`/`completion-photos` buckets, server-side DB moderation, `send-push` rate limit, redirect-URL pinning. Every security/privacy test below must be run **against the live target environment**, not just against source, and the tester must record which environment was used.

## 2. Test categories

Severity key: **Critical** = money wrong/lost or cross-user data leak or app unusable; **High** = core flow broken or lifecycle corruption; **Medium** = degraded flow or wrong non-money data; **Low** = cosmetic/edge. Automate-before-beta names the harness: **unit** (Jest/Vitest), **integration** (seeded Supabase + Stripe test mode), **e2e** (Maestro/Detox/Playwright).

## 3. First 72-hour beta monitoring checklist

Analytics/crash telemetry is currently **null** (`src/lib/analytics.js:12-13` — `SENTRY_DSN`/`ANALYTICS_KEY` null; no-op `track`/`captureError`/`identify`). Until Sentry + PostHog + native SDKs are wired, **watch external dashboards manually**: Supabase logs, Stripe dashboard, and edge-function logs are the primary signal. Check the following on a tight cadence (hourly for the first day, then every few hours):

**Payments (highest priority — Stripe dashboard + edge-fn logs):**
- **Payment capture success + earnings credit.** For each verified booking, confirm the Stripe capture succeeded AND `profiles.earnings_total` incremented once via `credit_earnings`. A captured-but-not-credited case = the webhook or RPC failed.
- **Stripe webhook deliveries.** Confirm the webhook is registered in the **live target mode** with the matching signing secret (test-mode registration does NOT carry over). Watch for failed/retried deliveries — if stale/missing, "payments still charge but earnings never credit and the Verified badge never appears."
- **Escrow holds not lingering.** Watch authorized-but-uncaptured PIs. Cancels/declines should release holds promptly; a failed release lets a hold auto-expire only after ~7 days. Investigate any hold older than expected on a resolved booking.
- **Fee correctness.** Spot-check that captured amount, 10% platform fee, and earner net match the authorization. Confirm the web-displayed `SERVICE_FEE_PCT` equals the backend 10% (potential display/charge mismatch).
- **Tips + partial captures.** Confirm each tip credited exactly once and each dispute wrote exactly one `disputes` row with a reason. Note: **no dispute adjudication/refund path exists** — any remedy is manual/out-of-band.

**Errors & crashes (Supabase logs + edge-fn logs, since analytics is null):**
- Watch edge-function error rates for `accept-booking`, `stripe-*`, `send-push`, `support-submit`, `student-verify-*`. Fail-open designs (assistant cost cap, `send-push` limit) log loudly if their backing table is missing — grep for "cost cap NOT enforced" and rate-limit fail-open lines.
- Watch Postgres logs for guard-trigger reverts and RLS denials that indicate someone probing boundaries, and for any 5xx from PostgREST.
- On mobile, the root `ErrorBoundary` catches render crashes but reports only to the null analytics buffer — so crash signal must come from user reports and any store crash dashboards once on a real build.

**Sign-up & onboarding funnel:**
- Sign-up → email-verify → first-login-through-onboarding completion rate. Watch for users stuck at email verification (Resend/domain config) or bouncing on username uniqueness.
- Confirm `legal_acceptances` rows are being written (mobile records best-effort AFTER the profile update — a silent failure leaves a user marked onboarded but re-hitting the consent gate).
- Student `.edu` verification: confirm Resend verified domain + `STUDENT_VERIFY_FROM` are set live, else student emails only reach the account owner.

**Moderation & support:**
- **Moderation queue** — triage new `reports` daily; confirm resolve/reopen works and audit rows land.
- **Support inbox** — watch the Resend support inbox and `support_tickets`; confirm the intake rate limits aren't blocking legitimate users and no CAPTCHA-less flood is occurring.
- Content-filter drift — the blocklist lives in three hand-maintained copies; the `moderationSync.test.js` guard should stay green in CI.

**Deploy-state verification (do this before opening the beta, then confirm holds):**
- Confirm the audit/hardening migrations + edge redeploys are actually applied to LIVE Supabase/Vercel/Stripe: certificates MIME allowlist, private `chat-photos`/`completion-photos` buckets, server-side DB moderation, `send-push` rate limit, redirect-URL pinning. If not applied, those protections are absent in production.

## 4. Open questions / for Fable to verify

1. **Live deploy state is the largest unknown.** Many `AUDIT_REPORT.md` fixes are code-complete on `master` but marked "needs push/deploy." Every security/privacy/permission test above must be run against the **live** target. Confirm: private photo buckets, certificates MIME allowlist, server-side moderation, `send-push` throttle, redirect pinning are all live.
2. **Stripe live cutover + webhook** — is the webhook registered in the target mode with a matching signing secret, and are Connect + Identity enabled live? This is the linchpin for earnings crediting and the Verified badge; unverifiable from code.
3. **Amendment direction contradicts CLAUDE.md.** The code is **poster-proposes / earner-responds** (guard confirms: poster may only set `pending`/`none`, earner reaches `accepted`/`declined`). CLAUDE.md says the opposite — flag and reconcile.
4. **`jobs.status` has no server-side transition guard** — client-trusted; `'booked'` is a dead enum value never written. Confirm whether a transition guard is needed. `bookings.status` IS heavily guarded (`guard_bookings_write`).
5. **Fee constant mismatch risk** — backend hardcodes 10% (`stripe-create-payment-intent:100`, `stripe-capture-payment:129`); web UI uses `SERVICE_FEE_PCT` from `@/lib/config` for display. Verify they agree, or the earner sees a fee different from what's charged.
6. **No dispute adjudication/refund path** — disputes are a terminal audit row; the admin payments page is read-only. Is manual/out-of-band resolution acceptable for beta?
7. **No MIME/size allowlist on `receipts` and `completion-photos`** (only `certificates` has one). A direct-Storage upload under the uid folder could store non-image content. Verify Storage config.
8. **Amendment `accepted` is sticky** — cleared only by client `clearAmendment`; a skipped clear leaves core terms editable. No server auto-clear. Also, the earner branch of the guard does not pin `amendment_status`, so an earner could write `pending`/`none` — confirm acceptable.
9. **CSP posture** — `next.config.ts:4` says ENFORCING; TESTFLIGHT said report-only. Verify which is live and whether `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` remain in prod.
10. **Mobile reset-password** hardcodes `https://gohustlr.com/reset-password` with no native reset screen. If that domain/allow-list breaks, mobile reset dead-ends. Not verified live.
11. **No CI gate confirmed in scope** — verify `npm test` runs in CI and blocks merges; otherwise even the 79 passing unit tests provide no regression gate. No coverage numbers exist (Jest runs without `--coverage`).
12. **`web/` is Jest-ignored and `admin/` has zero tests** — acceptable for beta, or a gap to weight? A destructive `deleteUserCascade` (`admin/lib/deleteUser.ts`) has no test.
13. **Fresh-DB reproducibility** — the audited state = `schema.sql` + all `supabase/migrations/` applied in timestamp order. `schema.sql` alone (or the legacy `migration_*.sql` set only) is more permissive. Confirm the live DB matches the tracked-migration state (diff live `pg_policies`), and that no `tmp_audit_diag` debug function remains EXECUTE-able live.
14. **Anthropic API key rotation** — confirm the previously-exposed key was rotated (`TESTFLIGHT.md:66`); it gates `assistant` + `support-ai-draft`.
15. **Push requires a real build** — `expo-notifications` is native; Expo Go on SDK 54 can't receive remote push. Needs APNs (iOS) / FCM (Android) + a production/dev build before push tests are meaningful.
16. **Two dead mobile screens** (`BrowseScreen.js`, `MyJobsScreen.js` — unregistered; `MyJobsScreen` references non-existent `appliedIds`). Confirm unreachable; noted as dead code, not to be removed.
